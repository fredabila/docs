The **Updates** tool allows you to broadcast announcements across multiple channels. This guide explains how to use each communication method effectively.

## Push Notifications

Push notifications are ideal for urgent, real-time alerts (e.g., "The keynote is starting" or "Venue change"). These appear instantly on the devices of all attendees who have the Yenhyia app installed and are checked into your event.

### Sending a Push Alert
1.  Navigate to the **Push Notifications** tab.
2.  **Title**: Enter a short, attention-grabbing headline (e.g., "Change of Venue").
3.  **Message**: Type your update details. Keep it concise as it appears on a lock screen.
4.  **Send**: Click **Send Alert** to broadcast immediately to all checked-in attendees.

## Email Campaigns

Use email for detailed newsletters, daily recaps, or post-event thank you notes.

### Composing an Email
1.  Navigate to the **Email Campaigns** tab.
2.  **Subject Line**: Enter a compelling subject line (e.g., "Thank you for coming! + Recap").
3.  **Content Editor**:
    - **Write HTML**: You can type plain text or paste custom HTML code for fully branded designs.
    - **Personalization**: Click the tags above the editor (e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{role}}`, `{{company}}`) to insert dynamic placeholders. These will be replaced with the actual attendee's data when sent.
    - **AI Draft**: Stuck on what to write? Click **AI Draft** to have Yenhyia generate a professional email for you based on your event details.
4.  **Select Audience**: In the right sidebar, choose who receives this email:
    - **All Attendees**: Everyone on your guest list.
    - **All Pre-Registered**: Only those who registered online.
    - **Pre-Registered (Not Checked In)**: Useful for sending reminders to those who haven't arrived yet.
5.  **Send**: Click **Send Campaign** to deliver via Yenhyia Mail.

## WhatsApp Updates

Send official messages directly to attendee WhatsApp accounts using the Yenhyia Business API.

### Sending a WhatsApp Blast
1.  Navigate to the **WhatsApp** tab.
2.  **Message**: Type your update in the text box.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **24h Rule**: This message starts a 24-hour conversation window. Keep the first message concise and valuable to encourage a response or acknowledgement.
3.  **Send**: Click **Send WhatsApp Blast**. This will be sent to all checked-in attendees who have provided a valid WhatsApp number.

## SMS Broadcasts

Send text message alerts to ensure maximum reach, even for users without data.

<Note>
This feature requires an active **mNotify** integration. Ensure your balance is topped up.

### Sending an SMS
1.  Navigate to the **SMS** tab.
2.  **Target Audience**: Select who should receive the text:
    - **All Attendees**: The entire list.
    - **Segment**: Target specific ticket tiers or roles.
    - **Specific People**: Search for individual names.
3.  **Message**: Type your update.
    - Note the character counter: **160 characters = 1 credit**. Exceeding this will consume multiple credits per recipient.
4.  **Send**: Click **Send SMS Blast**.

## Community

The **Community** tab allows you to create a dedicated WhatsApp group for your event. Unlike the broadcast tool, this creates a two-way chat environment where attendees can network with each other. Users can join this group directly from their event app.
