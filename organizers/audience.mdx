The **Audience** tool is designed to help organizers build lasting communities around their events. It automatically aggregates data to give you a comprehensive view of your reach.

## How It Works

Building an audience on Yenhyia requires no manual data entry. Your community grows automatically through two primary actions:

1.  **Event Check-ins**
    Every attendee who successfully checks into one of your events is automatically added to your audience.
    
2.  **Page Followers**
    Users who visit your event page or organizer profile and click "Follow" are instantly added to your community.

## Managing Your Audience

To access your audience data, navigate to the **Organizer Dashboard** and click on the **Audience** tab.

`...` > `Billing` > `API Keys` > `Integrations` > `Sponsors` > **`Audience`**
