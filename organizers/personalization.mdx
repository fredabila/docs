When attendees join your event via QR code or link, they go through a specific onboarding flow. The **Personalization** tool allows you to customize exactly what information is collected and how strict the signup process is.

## Profile Fields

Control which fields attendees are asked to fill out during signup. You can manage the following fields:

- **Job Title / Role**
- **Company / Organization**
- **Short Bio**
- **Phone Number**

### Configuring Fields
For each field, you have two controls:
1.  **Visibility (Eye Icon)**: Toggle this ON (Green) to show the field in the signup form, or OFF (Grey) to hide it.
2.  **Required Field**: Check this box to make the field mandatory. Attendees cannot complete signup without filling it in.

## Interest Tags

Tags help categorize your attendees based on their professional interests. These tags are used for networking matching and analytics.

### Managing Tags
1.  **Status**: Ensure the **Interest Tags Step** toggle is set to **Enabled**.
2.  **Add Custom Tag**: Type a new tag name (e.g., "Fintech", "Generative AI") in the text box and click the **+** button.
3.  **Default Tags**: The platform comes with a robust set of default tags (SaaS, Cybersecurity, etc.). You can replace them with your own event-specific keywords.

## Guest Rules

Customize how users enter your event app.

### Seamless Guest Check-in
- **Enabled**: Allows users to skip the full signup process (creating a password, adding a bio) for faster entry. This is ideal for events where speed is prioritized over data collection.
- **Disabled**: Forces every user to create a full profile before entering the event space.

### Networking Questionnaire
- **Enabled**: New attendees will answer a 6-question survey about their networking style (e.g., "Are you looking for investors?", "Do you want to mentor?"). This data feeds into the AI matchmaking algorithm to suggest relevant connections.
