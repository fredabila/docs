The **Venue** toolset allows you to bridge the gap between your digital event space and the physical location. You can upload blueprints, use AI to architect layouts, and deploy accurate geofences for real-time attendee tracking.


## Venue & Layout

This central hub is where you define the physical boundaries and amenities of your event.

### Manual Editor
To the left of the canvas, you'll find a suite of mapping tools:
- **Select**: Adjust and move existing elements.
- **Pen Tool**: Draw custom shapes and boundaries.
- **Zone**: Define specific areas (e.g., VIP Lounge, Stage).
- **Amenities**: Quickly drop icons for **Bars**, **Restrooms**, and **Exits**.

### Floor Plan Upload
If you have an existing blueprint, click **Upload Floor Plan** to bring your digital image into the canvas as a reference for your mapping.

## AI Venue Architect

Stuck on a design? The **AI Architect** allows you to generate professional floor plans from simple starting points.
- **Rough Sketches**: Draw a basic outline of your venue.
- **Descriptions**: Describe the layout (e.g., "A large exhibition hall with a center stage and 4 exits").
- **Simulations**: The AI generates a technical blueprint or vivid event map that you can then apply zoning to directly.

## Geofencing & GPS Link

Yenhyia's advanced geofencing tools ensure that your attendance data is as accurate as possible by linking digital maps to physical coordinates.

### Calibration
Click **Open GPS Tool** on-site to link your blueprint to the real world.
1.  **Geofence Calibrator**: Walk to the four extreme corners of your venue to pin the digital image to GPS coordinates.
2.  **Master Map**: Finalize the master calibration for the entire zone.

### Zone Mapping
Once the Master Map is calibrated, you can perform **Zone Mapping**:
- Select specific digital zones (e.g., "Booth B9").
- Walk the perimeter of that specific zone.
- Link the physical perimeter to the digital zone for precise check-ins and heatmaps.

> [!TIP]
> Use **Auto-Map (Walk Mode)** in the Point Collector to automatically capture coordinates as you walk the perimeter of a zone.
