The **People** tab is your hub for managing guest lists and gathering information. It consists of two main sections: **Attendees** and **Forms & Surveys**.

## Attendees

This section gives you full control over your guest list. You can view, search, and manage everyone who has registered for your event.

### Managing Your List
- **Add Attendee**: Manually enter details for a single guest to add them to the list.
- **Import CSV**: Bulk upload a guest list from a spreadsheet.
- **Export CSV**: Download your current attendee list for external use.

### Security
- **Strict Entry Mode**: Toggle `Strict Entry` **ON** to secure your event. When enabled, only individuals on your approved guest list can check in, preventing uninvited guests.

## Forms & Surveys

Build powerful data collection tools directly within Yenhyia. Similar to Google Forms, you can create polls, feedback forms, and questionnaires.

### Creating a Form
1.  Click **+ New Form**.
2.  **Customize Appearance**: Add a **Header Image URL** and set a **Primary Color** to match your brand.
3.  **Add Questions**: Choose from various question types (e.g., Short Text).
4.  **Settings**:
    - **Required**: Mark questions as mandatory.
    - **Smart Sync**: Map answers directly to user profile fields (e.g., automatically update a user's phone number or job title based on their response).

### Sharing
Once your form is saved, you can:
- **Copy Link**: Share the direct URL with your audience.
- **Embed**: Get the code to display the form on your own website.
