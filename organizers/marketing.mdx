Create a bespoke advertisement when you want to promote something specific, like a merchandise drop or a special announcement.

**Required Fields:**
- **Ad Title**: e.g., "Exclusive Merch Drop"
- **Description**: A short, catchy description to grab attention.
- **Image URL**: A direct link to your creative asset.

## Budget & Duration

Once your creative is ready, set your budget and timeline.

- **Campaign Budget**: Adjust the slider or enter an amount to see your **Estimated Total Reach**.
- **Duration**: Choose a preset duration of **3, 7, 14, or 30 days**.

If your wallet balance is insufficient, the launch button will prompt you to **Top Up & Launch**.
