The **Business** section is the administrative core of your event. It controls your public event data and manages your sponsorship relationships.

## Event Settings

Update the core information displayed on your event listing and app.

- **Event Name**: The official title of your even.
- **Event Description (About)**: A compelling summary of what your event is about. This is the first thing potential attendees will read.
- **Date & Location**: Ensure these are accurate to help users find you via the map and calendar.
- **Event Image/Artwork**: Upload a high-quality banner (Recommended size: 1200x630px). This image appears on your event card and guest check-in screens.
- **External URL**: Link to your own website if you have one.

## Sponsorship Hub

Manage your corporate partners and boost your event's visibility to potential sponsors.

### Visibility
- **Public Discovery**: Toggle this **ON** to make your event visible to brands browsing the Yenhyia network for sponsorship opportunities.
- **AI Matching**: The platform automatically matches your event with corporate sponsors whose CSR and marketing goals align with your audience demographics.

### Pitch Data
Fill out these fields to help the AI recommend you to the right partners:
- **Sponsorship Vision**: Why should brands sponsor you?
- **Target Audience Insights**: Who attends your event? (e.g., "Technology decision makers, 25-40").
- **Strategic Event Goals**: What are you achieving? (e.g., "Talent networking, product launches").

### Managing Partners
- **Corporate Sponsor ID**: A unique direct link/code. Sharing this with a sponsor allows them to bypass the public discovery phase and immediately add your event to their private portfolio.
- **Active Partner Line-up**: View all currently linked sponsors.
- **Add Partner**: If a sponsor has provided you with a **License Code**, enter it here to manually link them to your event.
